# Tasks that must be completed in every project. 

- `npx react-native init PROJECTNAME` -- make sure you know the desired name of the project before making one up
- review project specs and reserach/decide which libraries you are going to use to build out features (ie animations, tables, push notifications, authentication, drawer list items, ec.
- install, set up `react-navigation` -- make sure you have a general idea of navigation so you can set this up with placeholder screens
- install, set up `redux toolkit` -- a good way to make sure your config is working is just setting up the counter example on a button, [here's the documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
- for iOS projects, make sure you have the certificates and permissions you ned to work on the project in production
- set up authentication
- create the logic to connect to the API
- styling - create style constants for width/height, colors, text, etc in a tools or utils directory
- documentation - document everything you've done, especially any unique/interesting implemenations
