## RN Version + Addtl Considerations
_Ex: This app is version 63 and is iOS phone only._

## Getting Started
_Ex: How to install; for example if the app is pre-RN 64 may have to use a different version of XCode._

## Navigation
_Ex: This app uses this navigation library, this version, plus any special considerations, such as custom nav functions, etc._

## Styling
_Ex: Styling is not uniform, could benefit from cleanup, there are inline styles, let's create some default styles._

## Libraries
_Ex: any updates on some of the libraries, using a certain camera library, using bluetooth, using 2 different storage libraries for iOS/Android._

## Platforms
_Ex: any differences or notes between iOS/Android._

## Third Party Apps
_Ex: Bitrise, OneSignal, Google Analytics, AWS Amplify, etc. Anything we need to know or might need access to when developing this application._

## API + Authentication
_Ex: If we are going to be working on this, would be helpful to know what we're dealing with when it comes to API and Auth._

## App Publishing
_Ex: Are we going to be distributing the app? We may need certificates or other access, and there may be additional CI considerations._
