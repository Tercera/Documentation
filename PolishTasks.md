These are tasks you're going to want to go through when you're winding down a project:

- Make sure the keyboard clears any inputs -- on iOS _and_ Android
- Make sure any filters, or search terms, or any preferences a user can set in the app are re-set when they leave the screen, or when a process is completed, or whenever in the user story the UI should be reset
